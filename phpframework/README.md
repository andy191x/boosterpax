# PHPFramework

PHPFramework is a small, lightweight framework for PHP web applications written by Andrew Davis. The goal of the project is to provide useful wrappers that PHP doesn't natively offer. The intended use of the framework is rapid prototyping for small to medium PHP applications. For larger, high traffic PHP applications, consider using a framework backed by a development community.

Compatible with PHP 5.3 to 7.4 (and possibly newer releases).
